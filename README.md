# Ocaml

I've been using Ocaml for now two years, and here is everything I managed to make, going from a simple stack implementation, to more complex algorithms such as Quine (SAT) algorithm, CYK.

There will probably be a basic regex engine implementation in the future, as well as a grammar engine (using CYK algorithm).

For now, enjoy.
